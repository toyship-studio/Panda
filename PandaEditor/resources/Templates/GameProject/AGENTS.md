# ___PROJECTNAME___: a game on the Panda engine

A PandaEditor project. The entire project state is text files: worlds, materials and settings
are JSON, gameplay is C++. Any editor and any coding agent can read and edit them directly; the
running editor picks up the changes on one explicit command, Reload.

## Structure

- `Assets/` — worlds (`.world`, JSON), materials (`.mat`, JSON), textures, meshes (glTF). Next
  to each asset file the editor keeps a `<file>.pmeta` sidecar (asset id and import settings):
  together they are the asset registry.
- `Scripts/___PROJECTNAME___/src/` — the game's C++ scripts, built into a library the editor
  loads.
- `Scripts/___PROJECTNAME___/scripts/` — shell scripts for the builds (see "Building scripts").
- `.Panda/` — service data: `project.json` (the project settings), `scripts-manifest.json`,
  cooked data. Do not edit by hand.
- `Export/` — the build setup of the standalone game.
- `.zed/tasks.json` — tasks for the Zed editor (configure, build, open the export projects,
  format). `.clangd` points at the debug build's compile database.

## Working rules

- **Only a human runs and debugs the game.** Do not try to launch the editor or the game; ask
  the user to check and give feedback.
- **At the end of your work ask the user to press Reload (Cmd/Ctrl+R)** — the editor
  synchronizes with the disk in a single command: it rereads changed assets, the fresh script
  bundle and the world (by mtime). Broken world JSON is safe — the editor reports the error and
  keeps the current world. A conflict (newer on disk plus unsaved edits in the editor) is
  resolved by the user per item.
- Build the C++ scripts yourself (see "Building scripts") — Reload picks up the fresh library.
- New asset files are registered by the editor; do not edit `.pmeta` sidecars by hand.
- Detailed formats: `docs/` in the PandaSDK package (`world-format.md`, `assets.md`,
  `scripting.md`, `zed-and-agents.md`).

## Editing a world (`.world`)

A world is one JSON file under `Assets/`. Minimal entity:

```json
{
    "id": 2847561930,
    "tagComponent": { "tag": "MyEntity" },
    "relationshipComponent": { "parent": 0, "children": [] },
    "transformComponent": {
        "position": {"x":0,"y":0,"z":0},
        "rotation": {"x":0,"y":0,"z":0,"w":1},
        "scale": {"x":1,"y":1,"z":1}
    },
    "scriptListComponent": { "scripts": [] }
}
```

- `id` — a random uint32, unique within the file, not 0. Generate it and check with grep.
- `rotation` — a quaternion (identity = 0,0,0,1), not Euler angles.
- The hierarchy is two-sided: the parent's `children` AND the child's `parent`. `parent: 0` is a
  root. The positions of children are in the parent's local space.
- Optional components (camera, light, meshes, physics...) are just keys next to the others; the
  full list and the exact fields are in `world-format.md`. For an unfamiliar component, build it
  once in the editor, save the world and use the JSON as a sample.
- References to assets (mesh, texture, world) are ids from the assets' `.pmeta` sidecars
  (`<file>.pmeta` next to the asset file, key `id`).

## Script fields in a world

A script is attached to an entity in `scriptListComponent`; field values are set in the same
place:

```json
"scriptListComponent": {
    "scripts": [
        {
            "name": "MoveScript",
            "scriptFields": [
                { "name": "speed", "fieldId": 123456789, "type": 1, "value": 3.5 }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

- `.Panda/scripts-manifest.json` is the source of truth: the editor writes it on every script
  load with the class names, the fields, their `fieldId` and types. **Always take `fieldId` from
  there**, do not compute it. If the file is missing, ask the user to build/reload the scripts.
- `name` — the name of the C++ class (`REGISTER_SCRIPT`).
- `type` as a number: 0 integer, 1 float, 2 entity, 3 texture, 4 material, 5 world (the
  manifest has the same types as words).
- `value`: integer/float — a number; entity — the id of an entity of THIS world; texture/
  material/world — the asset id from the asset's `.pmeta` sidecar.
- List EVERY field of the script: a field that is not listed is written as zero when Play
  starts — the initializer in the C++ class is not used.
- A script without parameters: `{ "name": "MyScript", "scriptFields": [] }`.

## Assets and materials

- Put the file into `Assets/` — the editor registers new files when the project is opened or
  rescanned and assigns ids in the `.pmeta` sidecars. If the id of a new file is needed right
  away and the editor has not rescanned yet, ask the user.
- Textures: `.png/.jpg`. sRGB (color) by default; DATA maps (normal, roughness, noise) need
  sRGB switched off — ask the user to toggle it in the texture inspector.
- Meshes: `.gltf` (+ `.bin` and textures next to it). For every glTF material the editor creates
  `<name>.mat` next to the mesh; meshes of one folder share materials by name.
- A material (`.mat`) is JSON `{"inputs": [{"name","type","value"}]}`; `type`: 0 float, 1 uint,
  2 vec4, 3 texture (value — asset id, 0 = empty), 4 color (value — {x,y,z,w}). Edit the values
  freely; the SET and the ORDER of the fields are the shader's contract, do not change them.
  Create a new material in the editor (choosing a shader fills in the field template). The
  material's shader is stored in the `.pmeta` sidecar, not in the `.mat`.

## Building scripts

1. Edit the code (the script skeleton and fields — `scripting.md`: the `Script` class,
   `PANDA_FIELDS_*`, `REGISTER_SCRIPT`).
2. Build from a terminal:
   `Scripts/___PROJECTNAME___/scripts/configure_scripts.sh debug` (once),
   then `Scripts/___PROJECTNAME___/scripts/build_scripts.sh debug`.
   The scripts need `PANDA_SDK_DIR` set to `<PandaSDK>/lib/cmake/PandaSDK`. The same commands
   are the Zed tasks "Configure ___PROJECTNAME___ Debug" and "Build ___PROJECTNAME___ Debug".
   Fix compilation errors yourself, using the output.
3. Ask the user to press Reload (Cmd/Ctrl+R) — the editor picks up the fresh library (by mtime)
   and updates `.Panda/scripts-manifest.json`.
